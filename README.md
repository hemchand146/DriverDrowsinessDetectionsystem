# DriverDrowsinessDetectionsystem
This proposed system is used for Driver & Road safety system. Based on computer vision 
techniques, the driver’s face is located from a colour video captured in a car. Then, face detection is 
employed to locate the regions of the driver’s eyes, which are used as the templates for eye tracking 
in subsequent frames. The tracked eye’s images are used for drowsiness detection in order to 
generate warning alarms. The proposed approach has three phases: Face, Eye detection and 
drowsiness detection. The role of image processing is to recognize the face of the driver and then 
extracts the image of the eyes of the driver for detection of drowsiness. Hence, we conclude this 
approach is a low cost and effective solution to reduce the number of accidents due to driver's 
Drowsiness to increase the transportation safety.
